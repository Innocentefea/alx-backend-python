Async comprehensions were introduced in Python 3.6 as a way to create asynchronous generators. They provide a concise syntax for generating asynchronous sequences of values, similar to regular comprehensions.

Here's an example to illustrate how async comprehensions work:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_generator():
    for i in range(5):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an asynchronous operation
        yield i

async def main():
    # Create an asynchronous generator using an async comprehension
    async_generator_expr = (i async for i in async_generator())

    # Iterate over the values generated by the asynchronous generator
    async for value in async_generator_expr:
        print(value)

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

In the above example, we have an `async_generator` function that yields values asynchronously using the `yield` statement. In the `main` function, we create an asynchronous generator expression using the async comprehension syntax `(i async for i in async_generator())`. This expression creates an asynchronous generator that generates values from the `async_generator` function.

We then use `async for` to iterate over the values generated by the asynchronous generator and print them.

Note that async comprehensions can be used in various contexts where asynchronous sequences are needed, such as when working with `asyncio`, `aiohttp`, or any other asynchronous libraries or frameworks.

It's important to highlight that async comprehensions can only be used within an asynchronous context, such as an async function or a coroutine. Attempting to use async comprehensions in synchronous code will result in a `SyntaxError`.
