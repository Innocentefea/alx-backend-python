Variable annotations in Python allow you to specify the type of a variable using type hints. Type hints are not enforced at runtime but provide static analysis tools and IDEs with information about the expected types, which can be beneficial for code readability, debugging, and collaboration. Variable annotations were introduced in Python 3.6 as part of the "Variable Annotation" feature.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use variable annotations:

```python
name: str = "John"  # Variable 'name' is annotated as a string
age: int = 25  # Variable 'age' is annotated as an integer
is_student: bool = True  # Variable 'is_student' is annotated as a boolean

# Annotations can also be used with function parameters and return types
def greet(person: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {person}!"

result: str = greet(name)  # Variable 'result' is annotated as a string
```

In the example above, the variables`name`, `age`, and `is_student` are annotated with their respective types using the syntax `variable_name: type = initial_value`. The type hints indicate that `name` is a string, `age` is an integer, and `is_student` is a boolean.

Variable annotations can also be used with function parameters and return types. In the `greet` function, the parameter `person` is annotated as a string, and the return type is annotated as a string as well.

It's important to note that variable annotations are optional in Python, and their usage is not enforced by the language itself. They are primarily used for documentation purposes and to provide hints to static analysis tools and IDEs. The actual type checking and enforcement can be done using external tools like `mypy`.

It's also worth mentioning that starting from Python 3.10, the `:=` operator (also known as the "walrus operator") allows you to combine variable assignment and annotation in a single line. For example:

```python
name: str := "John"  # Variable 'name' is annotated and assigned a value in one line
```

This syntax can be useful in certain scenarios where you want to annotate and initialize a variable simultaneously.
