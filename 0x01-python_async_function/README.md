In Python, asynchronous programming allows you to write concurrent and non-blocking code, which can be particularly useful for tasks that involve I/O operations, such as making network requests or querying a database. Asynchronous functions are defined using the `async` keyword, and they can be awaited using the `await` keyword within other asynchronous functions or coroutines.

Here's an example of an asynchronous function in Python:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    # Simulate an asynchronous operation, such as making an HTTP request
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Data fetched from:", url)

async def main():
    # Call the asynchronous function and await its completion
    await fetch_data("https://example.com")

# Run the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, the `fetch_data` function is an asynchronous function that simulates fetching data from a URL. It uses the `await asyncio.sleep(1)` statement to simulate the delay of an asynchronous operation. The `main` function is another asynchronous function that calls `fetch_data` and awaits its completion.

To execute the asynchronous functions, we use the `asyncio.run()` function, which takes the main coroutine as an argument and runs it until completion.

Keep in mind that in order to use asynchronous functions and coroutines, you need to use an event loop provided by the `asyncio` module. The event loop manages the execution of asynchronous code and ensures that tasks are executed concurrently.

Async functions and coroutines allow you to write more efficient and responsive code by leveraging the benefits of asynchronous programming in Python.
